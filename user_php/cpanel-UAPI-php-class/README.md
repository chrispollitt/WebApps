##cPanel UAPI and API2 PHP class

PHP class to provide an easy to use interface with cPanelâ€™s UAPI and API2 (as of version 1.1).
The implementation is exactly the same for both, the processing done is slightly different behind the scenes.

v1.1 should be backwards compatible.

##Usage

See the example files, but typical useage takes the form of:

###UAPI
```
//load UAPI2 class
$cpuapi = new cpanelUAPI('user', 'password', 'cpanel.example.com');

//Set the scope to the module we want to use. in this case, Mysql
$cpuapi->scope = 'Mysql';

//call the function we want like this. Any arguments are passed into the function as an array, in the form of param => value.
$response = $cpuapi->get_restrictions(); 
print_r($response);
```

###API2
```
//load API2 class
$cpapi2 = new cpanelAPI2('user', 'password', 'cpanel.example.com');

//Set the scope to the module we want to use. in this case, SubDomain
$cpapi2->scope = 'SubDomain';

//call the function we want like this. Any arguments are passed into the function as an array, in the form of param => value.
$response = $cpapi2->addsubdomain(array('rootdomain' => 'domain.com', 'domain' => 'sub')); 
print_r($response);
```
